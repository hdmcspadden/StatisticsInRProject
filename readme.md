1. Are non-institutionalized adults residing in the US more likely to have had a flu shot in the last 12 months if they have had some college education? 
1. Are non-institutionalized adults residing in the US less likely to have exercised in the last 30 days if they have reported binge drinking in the last 30 days? Does the likelihood increase/decrease if they report binge drinking more than 10 days in the last 30 days?
